First Sprint: HW5 Writeup 
  Project Description Revision:
    Maanas
  Preliminary Coding For HW5 Submission: 
    Dylan and Tirth

Sprint: (Maybe 2 Week Sprints? Need Deadline for this Final Proj)
  1). Business Understanding - Done
  2). Data Collection - Done
  3). Data Preparation 
  4). Modelling/Programming Architecture 
  5). Model Evaluation
  6). Decide Deployment or Nah? 
  
 Goal: Have an MVP by half the time it's due. This way we will have plenty of time to focus on optimizing our algorithm. 
 
 Roles: Everyone should be coding and working on implementing whatever we've learned in class (and outside) on the project. Will decide what sections we can work on later
