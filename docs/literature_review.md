- This paper looks at several ML models in which could be used to perform linear regressions and stochastic gradient descent to determine the price of a car based on an image. Yang et al used a combination of several deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify the datasets of images and determine the price. They determined that using CNN's provided the most accurate results of all the methods provided. For the regression processing, instead of using lines, Yang et al used histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) to represent the linear regression of the model. To perform the convolutional layers, the team developed a new architecture called PriceNet. This architecture replaces 3x3 convolutions used in a similar architectures (SqueezeNet) with fire modules. Fire modules work by creating first a convolutional 1x1 layer and then sampled by combinations of both 1x1 and 3x3 convolutional layers. They concoluded that their network outperformed other models signifigantly and were able to better visualize the price, based on visual features of a car. With this technology, and with more tweaking, companies could determine the parts of cars that cause the price to be more and use better photos to market their products.
