- This paper looks at several ML models in which could be used to perform linear regressions and stochastic gradient descent to determine the price of a car based on an image. Yang et al used a combination of several deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify the datasets of images and determine the price. They determined that using CNN's provided the most accurate results of all the methods provided. For the regression processing, instead of using lines, Yang et al used histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) to represent the linear regression of the model. To perform the convolutional layers, the team developed a new architecture called PriceNet. This architecture replaces 3x3 convolutions used in a similar architectures (SqueezeNet) with fire modules. Fire modules work by creating first a convolutional 1x1 layer and then sampled by combinations of both 1x1 and 3x3 convolutional layers. They concoluded that their network outperformed other models signifigantly and were able to better visualize the price, based on visual features of a car. With this technology, and with more tweaking, companies could determine the parts of cars that cause the price to be more and use better photos to market their products.

## Review 2: Assessing Car Damage using Mask R-CNN

- In the car insurance industry, there is a big issue of case spillage, which is the difference between the amount of money that a person should have received in an accident and how much they actually receive when using picture-based estimations. The paper proposes that a network can be used to mechanicalize this process with a high degree of success. For their experiment, the researchers made a dataset of vehicles with various types of damage but also included images of undamaged cars, and split the data into training and test sets (unlabeled images). For their first attempt, they tried to use a CNN, however, with the dataset being unlabeled, they couldn't do much. Rather than using CNN, they used a performance learning procedure to isolate important features of unlabeled cars by learning the data scattering. This approach allowed them to remove redundant information while keeping useful information allowing them to find damaged parts of the vehicle; they were able to do this using a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE). And they used move learning to assist them. They found that move learning gives promising results when the dataset is unlabeled since it can adapt. Using the following methods, the reasearchers were able to locate vehicle damage 89.5% of the time.

## Review 3

 Summary: Recommendation systems are extremely important when it comes to targeted marketing of customers. And an important factor if a recommendation will be bought by a potential buyer will largely depend on the price of the item at hand. However, the author suggests a term, WTP, where it makes sense for the user to be willing to pay (WTP) a price for the item at interest. Purchase history of a user and the variable tolerances of price in different topics play are two examples the author identifies to understand the boundaries of WTP. Giving larger weightage to price points, the author proposes a solution that implements Graph Convolution Networks, and the factors of items and prices take place. This helps analyze the user's category-dependent price awareness. We felt this was largely relevant to our project due to it's emphasis on price optimization and thought that their unique solution of PUP Graph Convolutional Networks would be applicable as well.
